# TokenTrove (TNT)

**TokenTrove (TNT)** is an innovative NFT platform designed to create, manage, and trade digital assets with
enhanced functionality and flexibility. Built on the Ethereum blockchain using the ERC-721 standard, this
project allows artists, creators, and collectors to mint unique, verifiable digital tokens for their artwork
or collectibles. Each token is linked to custom metadata, and owners have exclusive rights to manage and trade their
NFTs in a decentralized environment.

# Key Features

The project offers several advanced features that set it apart from standard NFT implementations:

1. **Dynamic Metadata**  
   Each NFT includes a customizable URI for metadata, allowing creators to update certain elements while keeping
   the tokens uniqueness and rarity intact.

2. **Minting Fee Mechanism**  
   With a configurable minting fee, creators can manage and monetize their NFTs more effectively. The platform
   includes a straightforward fee structure to support development costs and ensure ecosystem sustainability.

3. **Royalty Support**  
   TokenTrove NFTs incorporates a built-in royalty system, allowing creators to receive a percentage of future
   sales on secondary markets. This ensures that artists and original owners continue to benefit from the long-term
   value of their work.

4. **Burn Capability**  
   Token holders have the power to remove NFTs they own from circulation by "burning" them, an irreversible
   action that reduces the supply and increases scarcity.

# Use Cases

1. Digital art galleries and marketplaces.

2. Collectible and rarity-based projects.

3. In-game assets and digital ownership proof.

4. Decentralized brand loyalty and rewards systems.

# Summary

With TokenTrove NFTs, our mission is to bridge creativity with technology, empowering artists and collectors
through a fair, transparent, and accessible NFT marketplace that respects creators and celebrates uniqueness.
